# Learning Rust Projects

This repository holds independent Rust learning projects, each in its own branch:

- `web_project`: Actix Web server + PostgreSQL backend
- `simple_port_scanner`: A basic Rust-based network port scanner

Each branch is standalone. This `main` branch serves only as a directory of contents.
